Hello! I'm Angel Buzany, a dedicated Software Engineer hailing from the vibrant landscapes of Mexico. Over the past few years, I've ventured through the fintech sector, climbing the ranks to positions like CTO and Engineering Manager. Despite my journey through management, my passion for coding and building from scratch hasn't wanedâ€”I thrive on the hands-on creativity that engineering offers.

Outside of work, I'm an avid soccer player, a globetrotter who loves to explore new cultures, an enthusiastic reader, and a gamer at heart. A little fun fact about me: I share my home with four dogs and a cat, and, interestingly, my last name is the only one of its kind in Mexico!

Welcome to my blog, where I share insights from my professional journey, my personal interests, and the simple joys of a life surrounded by code and tails wagging.
